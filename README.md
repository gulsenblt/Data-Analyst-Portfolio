# Data-Analyst-Portfolio
<h2>About</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm GÃ¼lsen! I have recently completed my Ph.D. in cognitive psychology and am actively seeking a full-time role in Data Analytics. Throughout my academic career, large-scale research projects and data-driven problems have enabled me to develop a strong analytical perspective. I have a deep understanding of human cognition, which is mostly associated with the processing, interpretation, and analysis of complex information, owing to my PhD studies. My hands-on research experience has also equipped me with a keen eye for detail and a broad understanding of statistical analytic techniques and tools. I am skilled at collecting, organizing, and analyzing big statistics, drawing insightful conclusions, and clearly conveying those conclusions to a range of audiences. These are skills that are directly applicable to the field of data analysis, and I am eager to transition my skills and expertise into the dynamic field of data analytics. My academic background may not fit with traditional paths in data analytics, but this does not hinder me from wanting to use it to promote creative problem-solving and provide meaningful results. I've finished the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program offered by Coursera, which helped me keep current on industry demanding and best practices. In addition, I am motivated about adopting new technology and procedures and have a strong desire for lifelong learning and development.</p>
