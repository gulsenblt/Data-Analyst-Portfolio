# Data-Analyst-Portfolio
Hi, I'm GÃ¼lsen! I have recently completed my Ph.D. in cognitive psychology. I have developed a strong analytical perspective throughout my academic career through large-scale research projects and data-driven questions. Through my PhD studies, I gained an in-depth understanding of human cognition, which is fundamentally concerned with the processing, interpretation, and analysis of complicated information. Furthermore, my practical research experience has given me an exacting attention to detail and an extensive knowledge of statistical analytic tools and procedures. I am skilled at collecting, organizing, and analyzing big statistics, drawing insightful conclusions, and clearly conveying those conclusions to a range of audiences. These are skills that are directly applicable to the field of data analysis, and I am eager to transition my skills and expertise into the dynamic field of data analytics. My academic background may not fit with traditional paths in data analytics, but this does not hinder me from wanting to use it to promote creative problem-solving and provide meaningful results. I've finished the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program offered by Coursera, which helped me keep current on industry demanding and best practices. In addition, I am motivated about adopting new technology and procedures and have a strong desire for lifelong learning and development.
