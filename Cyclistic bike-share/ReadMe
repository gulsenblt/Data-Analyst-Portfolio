<h1>CYCLISTIC BIKE-SHARE DATA EXPLORATION</h1>

This project is based on a case study from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification Course. This case study focuses on Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. There are two categories of bike users: annual members and casual riders. The marketing director thinks the company should focus on getting more yearly members to grow.  The analyst team wants to understand how yearly members and casual riders use their bikes differently, so this will help the company make a new marketing plan. The goal of this project is to analyze the usage pattern of casual and annual members.
